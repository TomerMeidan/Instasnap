# Instasnap

This repository contains the code for Instasnap, a simplified version of a social media app similar to Instagram. The app focuses on photo sharing and user interaction, and it is built using Java in Android Studio, along with Firebase as the backend service. The main features of Instasnap are described below:

## Features

1. **User Registration and Login**: Users can create a new account by providing their credentials or log in with their existing account using Firebase Authentication.
2. **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information, including their profile picture and bio, which will be stored in Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.
3. **Photo Upload**: Users can capture new photos using their device's camera or select existing photos from their device's gallery. These photos can then be uploaded to Firebase Storage.
4. **Data Persistence**: User data, including profile information and uploaded photos, will be securely and persistently stored in Firebase's database and storage services.
5. **User Experience Enhancements**: Instasnap prioritizes a seamless user experience by providing intuitive navigation, smooth transitions between screens, and an attractive UI design using Android Studio's layout tools.
